# iOS-Studies

Hey! This repo contains some code I've writen in order to improve my knowledge related to iOS and Swift programming. 
It's divided in study areas (such as memory, performance, Rx, etc) and most part of this areas contain only code snippets, 
such as playground files, related to their topic.

In case you're interested in seeing some open-source, more complete projects I've worked on, you can see the list below:

Besides this open-sources projects, I've also made/worked on the following projects that are in App Store. 
Here you can see the list of frameworks/tools/design patters/etc I've used to create them. Please, check it out!
